# Hexadecimal-Arrays
Write a program that reads in two hexadecimal numbers from a file, hex.dat, and prints out the sum of the two numbers in hexadecimal. (As noted in class, first do this without using a file and by reading using the cin>> command)
From Wikipedia:  “In mathematics and computer science, hexadecimal (also base 16, or hex) is a positional numeral system with a radix, or base, of 16. It uses sixteen distinct symbols, most often the symbols 0–9 to represent values zero to nine, and A, B, C, D, E, F (or alternatively a–f) to represent values ten to fifteen. For example, the hexadecimal number 2AF3 is equal, in decimal, to (2 × 163) + (10 × 162) + (15 × 161) + (3 × 160), or 10,995.”
For example, if the file contains:
45AF
12B3
 
your program will output (if you output the result in decimal):
 
           The decimal sum of 45AF and 12B3 is 22626.
